There are two common systems of right-hand keyboards for the accordion: 


- piano keyboard 

- button keyboard

## Right hand

### Button systems


The button accordion has at least three types of different models, but **they are almost identical from a composer’s point of view**. The most common are the C-griff (the C is on the first row) and B-griff (the C is on the third row). The third system is the Finnish keyboard, with the C on the second row.

The only meaningful difference is that the C-griff has the lowest notes of the left hand on the top (near to the air button) while the B-griff has the lowest notes of the left hand on the bottom (very far from the air button!)

### C-Griff

The right keyboard of the accordion has 105 buttons in five rows, with 3 effective rows. The 4th and 5th rows are repetitions of the 1st and 2nd. This
gives us many possibilities with fingering and in tonality, when transposing. We have a chromatic scale with a considerable range, from the second lowest E to the highest G of a 88 key piano keyboard (64 notes). Also known as **from E2 to G7**.


## Registers

The right hand has multiple options for different octave combinations and registers, just like the organ:

- one low voice (16 foot) that sounds one octave lower than the pressed key. The lowest note is then the lowest E of the piano, with the right
keyboard ranging from E1 to G6. The 16 foot register is always in “cassotto”.

- two central voices (8 feet) are the sounding pitch register. The two 8 foot registers are very different in timbre. The one drawn on the right of the circle is very bright, while the other (“cassotto”) is more muffled. “Cassotto” in Italian means “box”: this indicates that these reeds are inside a wooden or metallic box which softens the timbre.

- highest voice (4 foot) moves the majority of the keyboard one octave up, with the exception of the highest reeds, which are too difficult to keep in tune. The 4 foot register usually stop to C#8, but some accordions stop around Bb 7. This register also has a “third sound” in the highest notes and at loud volume.


These registers can be used in all possible combinations, so there are 15 different register combination that can alter both pitch and timbre. The standardized register symbols that are used in scores can be seen below.

When using registers that combine different octaves, it is always the lowest octave that defines the resulting sound.

I would actually suggest not bothering with registers symbols in the initial stages of composition, but to guide the player color indications such as dolce, tutti, metallic, nasal, flute, bassoon etc. The accordionist will choose a suitable registration to fit the description.
