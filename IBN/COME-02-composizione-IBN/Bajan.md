There are two common systems of right-hand keyboards for the accordion: 


- piano keyboard 

- button keyboard


### Button systems


The button accordion has at least three types of different models, but **they are almost identical from a composerâ€™s point of view**. The most common are the C-griff (the C is on the first row) and B-griff (the C is on the third row). The third system is the Finnish keyboard, with the C on the second row.

The only meaningful difference is that the C-griff has the lowest notes of the left hand on the top (near to the air button) while the B-griff has the lowest notes of the left hand on the bottom (very far from the air button!)

### C-Griff

**Estensione registro:** E2 - G7

The right keyboard of the accordion has 105 buttons in five rows, with 3 effective rows. The 4th and 5th rows are repetitions of the 1st and 2nd. This
gives us many possibilities with fingering and in tonality, when transposing. We have a chromatic scale with a considerable range, from the second lowest E to the highest G of a 88 key piano keyboard (64 notes). Also known as from E2 to G7.
